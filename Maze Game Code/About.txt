This is the first build of Maze Game finished 3/19/24!

Features:
* A title card with a main menu
* Exiting the program without using the "exit" button in a compiler
* Beginning a maze game, with a hard-coded start point
* A navigable maze with collision detection and boundary detection
* Placeholders for other features like health, stamina, and items
* Player stats stored in Player.java
* Game mechanics stored in GameData.java (Collision Detection is one)
* Easy to make more mazes!
    - Just make a new switch case and make one in a 2D array! No need to worry about hard-coding sizes nor ensuring it's a perfect square!
* Easy to add more non-passable blocks!
    - Just add an else if case with the same code above, insert the icon you want the block to have collision, and that's it!




Notes:
* I built this in IntelliJ, I know the Syllabus recommends Eclipse though I couldn't get it to work on my computer
* I tested it in OnlineGDB just to see what happens, sometimes a couple of the blocks will render as ï¿½ at complete random
    - For this reason, OnlineGDB is not recommended for running this
* Made with JDK 18.0.2
