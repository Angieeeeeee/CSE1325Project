Roxie's Idea: Buckshot Roulette (Java Edition)

  Buckshot Roulette is a game where two opponents face each other in the luck of a bullet. They may use items to help even these odds
The game is very similar in concept to the real-life game Russian Roulette though with the edition of items and a life-count, it differentiates itself

The game itself goes as follows:
Upon starting, you are given two modes, regular or hard
  * Regular difficulty: One game with a unique twist at the end where all bullets are worth double points
  * Hard difficulty: No twist at the end and is an endless mode (Called Double or Nothing where you can double your earnings)

When playing the game, it always starts at your turn at the beginning of every round and every time the rifle is reloaded.
  * The rifle is loaded with bullets at random, typically the amount of real shots and blanks are even though there are circumstances they are uneven
      * There is always at least 1 live and 1 blank bullet every time it is loaded.
      * The rifle is reloaded when there are no shots left (Both blank and live) and it is your turn at the beginning of every reload
  * You have the option to shoot yourself or the opponent, if you shoot yourself (with either a blank or live), it will remain your turn
  * You or your opponent may use any items while it's their turn without ending their turn. Each can carry a maximum of 8 items
  * When the rifle is reloaded, both opponents are given a new set of items, the quantity ranges from 2-4.
  * At the end of a round, all items are reset

Items in the game are as follows:
  * Knife, saws off the end of the rifle, causing the next shot to deal double damage, only lasts 1 turn and will undo itself, even if the shot was a blank (Cannot Stack)
  * Handcuffs, the opponent is equiped with handcuffs, the opponent has 2 turns skipped (Cannot Stack)
  * Beer, the user drinks a beer, unloads the current bullet inside the rifle
  * Maginifying Glass, the user breaks the magnifying glass and inspects the rifle, allows you to see the current bullet in the rifle
  * Cigarette, smokes 1 cigarette, regaining one life (called a charge), cannot go past max lives

New Concepts:
PVP Mode: A new mode where you and another real life player play with each other instead of a computer.
    * Will have to work out who's turn it is at the beginning of the game and at the beginning of every reload, perhaps a fun coin toss sub-game? Open for suggestions
Settings: A menu where you can change the game's settings, maybe ones such as computer intelligence, handcuff duration, item spawn rates, etc
Probably have to change the name of the game
